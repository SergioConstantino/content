##### Palo Alto Networks - Prisma Cloud Compute
- ***Breaking Change*** As a result of a change in the new version (22.06) of Prisma Cloud Compute, the prisma-cloud-compute-vulnerabilities-impacted-resources-list command has been updated:
  - The command now supports an argument called resourceType, which can be one of the following: 'container','image','host','function','codeRepo','registryImage'.
  - Due to product's limitation, when resourceType isn't sent - images and hosts returns by default.
  - The response now includes 'resourceID'.
